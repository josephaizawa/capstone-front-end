# QuickEncounter

## Overview

QuickEncounter is a web app designed for Dungeon Masters (DMs) to swiftly create challenging encounters by inputting party details and selecting or generating monsters. It uniquely allows DMs to level up lower-tier monsters for increased challenge diversity, addressing the time-consuming nature of encounter preparation in tabletop role-playing games.

### Problem

DMs need this app because prepping encounters can take hours. On top of that, leveling up monsters to match the partyâ€™s strength can add significantly to the preparation time. Existing apps often fall short by not providing leveled-up versions of lower-level monsters, making encounters feel repetitive. QuickEncounter addresses these issues by offering a quick and efficient way to create diverse and challenging encounters, including the ability to start with a specific or randomly suggested monster.

### User Profile

Both new and experienced DMs will use QuickEncounter. New DMs will get the help they need to create level-appropriate encounters, while experienced DMs can use it to quickly create encounters on the fly, making their campaigns feel more dynamic.

- **New DMs**: To create balanced and level-appropriate encounters with ease, reducing prep time and ensuring an enjoyable experience for their players.
- **Experienced DMs**: To quickly generate encounters during gameplay and customize monster levels, keeping the campaign engaging and varied.

### Features

- **Party Information Input**: DMs can input the number of party members and their levels.
- **Encounter Generation**: Automatically generate a list of appropriately challenging monsters based on party information.
- **Starting Monster Selection**: DMs can select a starting monster or have one randomly suggested.
- **Monster Leveling**: Add and level up lower-level monsters to create unique and challenging encounters.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React for web application development.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Database**: MySQL for storing monster data and encounter information.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible and efficient data querying and manipulation.
- **Traditional API Calls**: As a backup to GraphQL for data fetching and operations.
- **APIs**:
  - [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
  - [Open5e API](https://api.open5e.com/)

### APIs

- **Monster Data from APIs**: Initial monster data, including base stats and descriptions, will be pulled from external APIs such as the D&D 5e API and Open5e API.
- **Monster Stats in MySQL**: MySQL database stores updated monster stats based on user adjustments (leveling up/down).

### Sitemap

The app will be a single-page application (SPA) with the following flow:

1.  **Party Composition Input**: DMs can input the number of party members and their levels.
2.  **Starting Monster Selection**: DMs can select a starting monster based on party composition or have one randomly suggested.
3.  **Additional Monsters Suggestion**: Randomly suggest additional monsters to fill out the encounter.
4.  **Monster List and Stat Blocks**: Display a list of selected monsters and their stat blocks once the appropriate challenge rating is met for in-game use.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

#### Monster Data from APIs

- **Description**: Initial monster data, including base stats and descriptions, will be pulled from external APIs such as the D&D 5e API and Open5e API.
- **Usage**: This data will populate the app's monster selection and initial stats display for users.

#### Monster Stats in MySQL

- **Description**: MySQL database stores updated monster stats based on user adjustments (leveling up/down).
- **Usage**: When a user selects a monster and adjusts its level, the app queries the MySQL database to fetch updated stats based on predefined level-up tables. This ensures accurate and dynamically adjusted stats for each selected monster.

### Endpoints

- **GET /api/monsters**

  - **Parameters**: none
  - **Response**: List of available monsters with initial stats from APIs.

- **PUT /api/monsters/{monsterId}/level**

  - **Parameters**: monster ID, new level
  - **Response**: Updated monster stats based on MySQL data.

### Auth

Authentication features, including user registration and login, are being deferred from core functionality in the initial sprints. This feature will be prioritized for implementation in later phases of development.

## Roadmap

#### Sprint 1: Setup and Core Features

- Set up development environment.
- Implement basic app structure and navigation.
- Develop party information input and encounter generation functionalities.

#### Sprint 2: Monster Management and Enhancement

- Integrate monster selection and leveling features.
- Implement API integration for initial monster data retrieval.
- Develop MySQL integration for dynamic monster stat updates based on user adjustments.

## Nice-to-haves

- **User Registration**: Implement user registration and authentication to personalize user experience and save preferences.
- **Optimize Filter for Party**: Introduce options to filter encounters for casual or optimized parties to adjust challenge rating difficulty.
- **Connect to AI for Encounter Prompt**: Use AI to generate prompts or narrative hooks to start encounters, enhancing storytelling possibilities.
- **Ranking Strength of Party**: Develop a system to rank the strength of parties based on levels, considering party composition, classes, and subclasses.
- **Save User Info for Enhanced Filtering**: Store user information, including party makeup and monster preferences, to simplify encounter filtering and customization.
- **Generate Monster Tokens with AI Image Generation**: Utilize AI-powered image generation to create visual monster tokens for encounters, enhancing immersion and visualization.
